== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Upload the whole `wp-print` directory into your plugins folder(`/wp-content/plugins/`)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once installed take the following steps to set it up:

1. WP-Print settings page is located in WP-Admin -> Settings -> Print
1. You Need To Re-Generate The Permalink (WP-Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks -> Save Changes)
1. Refer To Usage For Further Instructions

= Usage =

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`
      You may place it in single.php, post.php, page.php, etc also.
1. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
1. Add Anywhere Below It: `<?php if(function_exists('wp_print')) { print_link(); } ?>`

* The first value is the text for printing post.
* The second value is the text for printing page.
* Default: print_link('', '')
* Alternatively, you can set the text in 'WP-Admin -> Settings -> Print'.
* If you DO NOT want the print link to appear in every post/page, DO NOT use the code above. Just type in <strong>[print_link]</strong> into the selected post/page content and it will embed the print link into that post/page only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add this to my theme? =

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`
      You may place it in single.php, post.php, page.php, etc also.
1. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
1. Add Anywhere Below It: `<?php if(function_exists('wp_print')) { print_link(); } ?>`

Simply add this code <strong>inside the loop = where you want the print link to display:
<code>
if(function_exists('wp_print')) {
	print_link();
}
</code>

= If you do not want to print a portion of your post's content =
<code>
[donotprint]Text within this tag will not be displayed when printing[/donotprint]
</code>
* The text within [donotprint][/donotprint] will not be displayed when you are viewing a printer friendly version of a post or page.
* However, it will still be displayed as normal on a normal post or page view.
* Do note that if you are using WP-Email, any text within [donotprint][/donotprint] will not be emailed as well.

= Custom Template =
* WP-Print will load 'print-css.css', '<strong>print-posts.php' and 'print-comments.php' from your theme's directory if it exists.
* If it doesn't exists, it will just load the respective default file that comes with WP-Print.
* This will allow you to upgrade WP-Print without worrying about overwriting your printing styles or templates that you have created.
