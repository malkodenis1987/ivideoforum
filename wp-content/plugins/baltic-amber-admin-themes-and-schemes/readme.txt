With Baltic Amber Themes & Schemes easily create unique color schemes
for your WordPress administration panel and adjust to your preferences.

== Description ==

With Baltic Amber Admin Themes & Schemes you can:

*    create your own colour scheme by specifying only two base colours,
*    have the theme colours change randomly every time you reload the page,
or at any time interval you choose,
*    use one of the administration themes which slightly alter/improve the
positioning of different administration panel elements, like the main navigation,
dashboard information and the plugin listing. There are eight basic colour options
available or you can specify your own base colours by choosing ‘My Colour Theme’,
or use the random colour theme generator.
*    place 'Tag' and 'Category' selection in two columns right after the text
editor in the 'Write Post' panel. This option can be enabled for every admin
theme, including the default ones.

= Baltic Amber vs. the default admin theme =

*    Uses relative `em` values instead of `pixels` for defining element
dimensions and sizes, thus making the whole interface scalable to your own preference.
*    Baltic Amber themes improve the scanability of the plugin list
by replacing the darker background colour with a green ribbon on the side for
the activated plugins.

= Compatibility with the drop-down menu plugins =

As many of you prefer to replace the main navigation with a drop-down alternative,
here are the admin menu plugins that have been tested to work with Amber Themes:

1.    [Ozh Admin Drop Down Menu](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/ "Admin Drop Down Menu for WordPress 2.5") (2.1) by Ozh,
2.    [Drop Down Admin Menus](http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/ "Drop Down Admin Menus for WordPress 2.5") (2.5.3) by Andy Staines

== Installation ==

1.    Download the plugin and unzip its content.

2.    Upload the baltic-amber directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. The
final directory tree should look like `/wp-content/plugins/baltic-amber/baltic-amber.php`

3.    Activate the plugin at the Plugin Management section under ‘Plugins’ menu.

4.    Colour Scheme and Theme selection in Your Profile Go to your User Profile
(under ‘Users’ > ‘Your Profile’ or by clicking on your name at the top right
corner of the administration panel).

5.    Choose either Random Color scheme or My Color scheme, or one of the admin
themes that you would like to use in the Admin Color Scheme section and
click ‘Update Profile’.

6.    If you decide to use either the Random Colour or the My Colour theme,
configuration options are available under ‘User’ > ‘Baltic Amber Colour Settings’.

7.    ‘Realign Category and Tag selection as columns in the New Post panel’ option
can be enabled under ‘User’ > ‘Baltic Amber Colour Settings’
